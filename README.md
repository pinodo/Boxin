# Boxin

Due to Covid-19, people hesitate to transact the used item in person.

In this vein, I came up with the idea that people can purchase and sell their used item in a designated place, which has a bunch of secure box slots that people can see the items through the window.

Boxin is an indirect transaction management system, which manages the available slots and connects the seller and buyer.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, git.
